    "### Overview: Time Series Modeling Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous lessons, we explored Python implementations of fundamental time series concepts including stationarity, smoothing, trend, seasonality, and autocorrelation, and built two kinds of models: \n",
    "\n",
    "  * **MA models**: Specify that the current value of the series depends linearly on the series' mean and a set of prior (observed) white noise error terms.\n",
    "  * **AR models**: Specify that the current value of the  series depends linearly on its own previous values and on a stochastic term (an imperfectly predictable term).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the current lesson we will review these concepts as well as combine these two model types into three more complicated time series models: ARMA, ARIMA, and SARIMA. We will then explore a different type of Time Series modeling using __[Facebook Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/https://facebook.github.io/prophet/)__. \n",
